<hr>

<p>This project is the idea I came to General Assembly with. It&#39;s not fully functional but once completed it will be a full CRUD cake inspiration application.</p>
<p>##Project Inspiration/Theme

<p>##User&#39;s Stories</p>
<ul>
<li>When a user linked to the page they have the option to create and account, login, or go straight to the cake gallery.</li>
<li>If an account is created a &quot;user&#39;s page&quot; will show. Once signed in a user can add cakes to the gallery, logout, and delete their account.
Future features:</li>
<li>A user can create a cake design, edit the design, save it to their own gallery, and or send it to a bakery.</li>
<li>A user view their gallery, edit their gallery, delete design off their gallery</li>
</ul>

<p>##Technologies Used</p>

<li>HTML/CSS/JS</li>
<li>AngularJS</li>
<li>PostgreSQL</li>
<li>Ruby on Rails</li>
<li>NodeJS &amp; Express</li>
<li>Bootstrap/ Sass</li>
<li>CORS/Authentication with JWT</li>
</ul>
<p>##Future Features</p>
<ul>
<li>Add cake to users gallery</li>
<li>Create a cake design, save a cake design, email a cake design</li>
<li>google maps api for bakery search</li>
<li>Auto refresh on data</li>
</ul>
<p>##Issues &amp; Bugs</p>
<ul>
<li>I spent a lot of time researching and developing a cake design canvas, which works perfectly outside of the app, but have not been able to include it currently.</li>
<li>Once cake is created unshift function breaks code so page needs to be refreshed to show new added cakes.</li>
<li>I set this app up with the intention of having the /cakes route only work as a show route and a separate route was created to store creations into a users gallery from the canvas. Unfortunately, since the canvas/creations route isn&#39;t set up I had to merge the added cakes to the /cakes route alone. This created a trickle down effect and hindered my other needed CRUD features.</li>
</ul>
